## Hi!👋 | नमस्ते! 👋

I'm Raghav. You may know me as `kilacoda` or `the guy who used to work on Manim` or `the guy who made chanim` or `the Manim chemistry videos guy` or something else :)
I make stuff from time to time and love to explore new things.

At the moment, I’m working on designing keyboards and input methods for Indian languages and scripts (starting with Hindi/Devanagari for now). I'm also making a GitHub Pages site for myself.

If you have a question/need help with something/want to work together on something or (most importantly) hire me, feel free to reach out in the socials listed in my profile!
